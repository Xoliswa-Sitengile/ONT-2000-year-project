# ONT-2000-year-project
This project is due on the 28 October 2022.   All students should work in groups of 5, unless you have one extra person, in which case you will need to let me know.   All programs should be developed using the 3-tier application.   All programs should make use of Validation, and RegularExpressions where necessary.   Only one student should submit both the documentation and the project.   A non-functional project will result in all students getting a zero for the project.   For the illustration video, you are required to add the link to the recording in your documentation.
